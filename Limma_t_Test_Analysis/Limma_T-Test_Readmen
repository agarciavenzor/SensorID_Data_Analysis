# SensorID LIMMA multiple T-Test analysis
The section Limma T-Test contains all the R scripts and files to analyze the SensorID experiments' 
raw data for mass spectrometry. The section is divided into two parts with independent set of files:
## 1. **SensorID dynamic interactome analysis**, containes the next files:
 -+ SensorID_Limma_T_Test.R: R Script for analyzing the SensorID dynamic interactomes mass spectrometry raw data.
 -+ Sirt6ID_RawData.csv: Sirt6ID mass spectrometry Intensity raw data, each sample contains 3 biological replicates.
 -+ Ku80ID_RawData.csv: Ku80ID mass spectrometry Intensity raw data, each sample contains 3 biological replicates.
 -+ Mre11ID_RawData.csv: Mre11ID mass spectrometry Intensity raw data, each sample contains 3 biological replicates.
 -+ Mre11ID_RawData.csv: Mre11ID mass spectrometry Intensity raw data, each sample contains 3 biological replicates.
 -+ ColAnnoDF.csv: SensorID dynamic interactomes Sample metadata.
 -+ SensorID_FoldChange_Matrix.csv: SensorID dynamic interactome Fold Change values versus the negative controls. Mannually filtered.

## 2. **SensorID shNucleolin Experiments Interactome analysis**, contains the next files:
 -+ SensorID_shNclExp_Limma_T_Test.R: R Script for analyzing the raw data of SensorID shNucleolin Experiments Interactome mass spectrometry.
 -+ SensorID_shNclExp_RawData_All.csv: SensorID shNucleolin Experiments Interactome mass spectrometry Intensity raw data, each sample contains 3 biological replicates..
 -+ SensorID_shNclList_Diff_Prots.csv: List of the Differentially bound proteins in the SensorID shNcl experiments and their annotations. Mannually curated.
