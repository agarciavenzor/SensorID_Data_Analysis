### [SensorID dynamic interactome Network analysis with igraph](./SensorID_Network_Analysis)
This repository section encompasses the network analysis of the SensorID dynamic interactomes. The network analysis was done using the functions contained in the igraph R package. However, the visualization of the network was performed on Cytoscape due to its multiple layout software and easier mapping of variables in the network graphs. Notably, each network is uploaded as a separate edge list. Each list was retrieved from the String database by quering all the proteins contained in the specific time point interactome and filtering the physical interactions by a threshold of 0.4 confidence. The SensorID matrix file contains the node metadata, including the functional annotations and the fold change at specific time points.
This section of the repository contains the following files:
**SensorID_Network_Analysis**
