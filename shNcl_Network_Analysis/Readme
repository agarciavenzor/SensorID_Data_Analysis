### [SensorID shNcl Experiment Network analysis with igraph](./shNcl_Network_Analysis)
This repository section encompasses the network analysis of the SensorID IR2h interactomes after the silencing of Nucleolin using a specific shRNA (shNcl). The comparisons are done against the SensorID IR2h interactome treated with a control shRNA (shScr). The network analysis was done using the functions contained in the igraph R package. However, the visualization of the network was performed on Cytoscape due to its multiple layout software and easier mapping of variables in the network graphs. Notably, each network is uploaded as a separate edge list. Each list was retrieved from the String database by quering all the proteins contained in the specific time point interactome and filtering the physical interactions by a threshold of 0.4 confidence. The SensorID shNclExp Matrix file contains the node metadata, including the functional annotations and the fold change versus the negative controls of the experiments. It also contains the statistical test of the shNcl condition versus the shScr condition.
This section of the repository contains the following files:
**shNcl_Network_Analysis**
The section shNcl_Network_Analysis contains all the R scripts and files for the network analysis of the SensorID shNcl experiment interactomes:
