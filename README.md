## Abstract
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are critical genomic lesions. DSBs are repaired by two main pathways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The activity of the sensor proteins at the DSB site has a major role in influencing the repair outcome. However, little is known about how each DSB sensor proteins may simultaneously integrate different nuclear processes to efficiently cope with the DNA lesions. In this study, we generated SPARK, the dynamic Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of three DSB-sensors (Sirt6, Ku80, and Mre11) during DSB-repair. Using proximity-labeling assays, we unravel the DSB-sensor dynamic-interactome. Our results show that each sensor has a unique interactome, which reacts to DSB induction and progressively expands to include new specific nuclear functions. Although the sensors rely on a common core of nuclear processes, sensor-specific interactors allow functional differences and confer robustness during DDR. Moreover, we discovered that PPI networks contain connector nodes, which coordinate the function of large nuclear processes occurring simultaneously. Altogether, our study shows how three DSB-sensor proteins coordinate and regulate broad nuclear processes through deep changes in the structure and composition of their interactome, relying on a small set of connector proteins to coordinate big macromolecular complexes.
